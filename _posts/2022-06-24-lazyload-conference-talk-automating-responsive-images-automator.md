On June 24th 2022 I spoke about **responsive images optimisation 4.0** at the [LazyLoad conference 2022](https://webdirections.org/lazyload/). The speech was on how to improve performance on your website by automating responsive images, with a data-driven approach.

The tool the talk was about is [responsive-images-automator](https://github.com/verlok/responsive-images-automator).

## Video and slides

Here's the video of my talk.
