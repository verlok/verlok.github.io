On April 1st 2022 I spoke about **responsive images optimisation 4.0** at the [CSS Day 2022 Conference](https://2022.cssday.it) in Faenza, Italy. The speech was on how to improve performance on your website by automating responsive images.

Here are the slides of my talk, from my <a href="https://www.slideshare.net/verlok">SlideShare</a>:

The talk was rated very positively both with in-person feedback and [on joind.in](https://joind.in/event/cssday-2022/-ottimizzazione-immagini-40-a-data-driven--test-driven-approach).

The video of the talk will be available soon at <a href="https://vimeo.com/grusp">GrUSP on Vimeo</a> and on this page.
