On April 1st 2022 I spoke about **responsive images optimisation 4.0** at the [CSS Day 2022 Conference](https://2022.cssday.it) in Faenza, Italy. The speech was on how to improve performance on your website by automating responsive images.

The tool the talk was about is [responsive-images-automator](https://github.com/verlok/responsive-images-automator).

The talk was rated very positively! [Read feedback on joind.in](https://joind.in/event/cssday-2022/-ottimizzazione-immagini-40-a-data-driven--test-driven-approach).
