It's not the first time I get asked the question: <q>what is the difference between vanilla-lazyload and lazy sizes?</q> It's now time to answer the question once and for all.

<!-- ðŸ¤« Quick answer: find all the differences [in this table](https://github.com/verlok/vanilla-lazyload/blob/master/README.md#vanilla-lazyload-vs-lazysizes) -->

## What are vanilla-lazyload and lazy sizes?

[vanilla-lazyload](https://github.com/verlok/vanilla-lazyload/) and [lazysizes](https://github.com/afarkas/lazysizes/) are two popular Javascript libraries to [lazy-load](https://web.dev/lazy-loading/) images and other DOM elements lazily, meaning <strong>load them only when they enter the visible portion of the web page</strong>, or a little bit earlier than they do.

Both of them are great solutions to improve the <strong>rendering time</strong> of your website, by delaying all non-crucial content to when users <strong>scroll down the page</strong>, ultimately getting better [Core Web Vitals](https://web.dev/cwv) values as a result, and especially an improved [Largest Contentful Paint](https://web.dev/lcp).

So what are the <strong>differences between vanilla-lazyload and lazysizes</strong>?

Both of them are very populare libraries used in production on thousand websites, so I've written this very detailed comparison.

## Table rows explanained

### Is extendable

Both vanilla-lazyload and lazysizes are extendable, see [vanilla-lazyload API](https://www.github.com/verlok/vanilla-lazyload#-api) and [lazysizes plugins](https://github.com/aFarkas/lazysizes/tree/gh-pages/plugins). 

### Is SEO friendly

Both scripts **don't hide images/assets from search engines**. No matter what markup pattern you use. Search engines don't scroll/interact with your website. These scripts detect whether or not the user agent is capable to scroll and if not, they reveal all images instantly.

### Optimizes performance by cancelling downloads of images that already exited the viewport

If your mobile users are on slow connections and scrolls down fast, vanilla-lazyload cancels the download of images that are still loading but already exited the viewport. If for some reason you don't want this to happen, you can turn this feature off bu setting the option `cancel_on_exit` to `false` (default is `true`).

### Retries loading after network connection went off and on

If your mobile users are on flaky connections and go offline and back online, vanilla-lazyload retries downloading the images that errored.

### Supports conditional usage of native lazyloading

If your users are on a browser supporting native lazyloading and you want to use it, with vanilla-lazyload you can conditinally activate it by setting the `use_native` option to `true`. Find here [more information](https://github.com/verlok/vanilla-lazyload#mixed-native-and-js-based-lazy-loading) and the [conditional native lazyload demo](https://www.andreaverlicchi.eu/vanilla-lazyload/demos/native_lazyload_conditional.html).

### Works with your DOM, your own classes and data-attributes

Both scripts work by default with the `data-src` attribute and the `lazy` class in your DOM, but on vanilla-lazyload you can change it, e.g. to `data-origin`, if you want to migrate from other lazy loading scripts to vanilla-lazyload without changing your HTML markup.

### Can lazyload responsive images

Both vanilla-lazyload and lazysizes can lazyload responsive images by all kinds, e.g. simple `img` tag like the following

```html
<img src="..." srcset="..." sizes="...">
```

```html
<picture>
    <source media="..." srcset="" ...>
    <img ...>
</picture>
```

### ...and automatically calculate the value of the `sizes` attribute

lazysizes has the advantage that it can derive the value of the `sizes` attribute from your CSS by using Javascript.
vanilla-lazyload doesn't have this feature because of performance optimization reasons: to be useful on eagerly loaded images, the `sizes` attribute is useful when it's set in the HTML markup, not when it's set by javascript.

### Can lazyload iframes

Both vanilla-lazyload and lazisizes can lazyload the `iframe` tag.

### Can lazyload videos

Only vanilla-lazyload can lazyload the `video` tag, even with multiple `source`s.

### Can lazyload background images

Only vanilla-lazyload can lazyload background images. And also multiple background images. And supporting HiDPI such as Retina and Super Retina display.

### Can lazily execute code, when given elements enter the viewport

Check out the [lazy functions](https://www.github.com/verlok/vanilla-lazyload#lazy-functions) section and learn how to execute code only when given elements enter the viewport.

### Can restore DOM to its original state

Using the `restoreAll()` method, you can make LazyLoad restore all DOM manipulated from LazyLoad to how it was when the page was loaded the first time.
