To avoid **layout shifting** and optimize for the [Cumulative Layout Shift](https://web.dev/cls/) [web vital](https://web.dev/vitals/) in you web pages, you need to reserve space for any **content that might be rendered later in time**. This is the case for images, videos and any asynchonously loaded content (e.g with AJAX calls). Here's a new way to do it.

<figure>
  <div class="post-image-spacer" style="background-color: #eee">
    <img alt="Boxes of different aspect ratios and the text: &quot;A modern way to reserve space for lazy images and async content in responsive design&quot;" src="/assets/post-images/aspect-ratio__2x.png" srcset="/assets/post-images/aspect-ratio__1x.png 1x, /assets/post-images/aspect-ratio__2x.png 2x" class="post-image">
  </div>
</figure>

## The good old way

The traditional way to reserve space for images is to use the vertical padding trick.

```html
<div class="image-wrapper">
  <img alt="An image" src="image.jpg" />
</div>
```

```css
.image-wrapper {
  width: 100%;
  height: 0;
  padding-bottom: 150%;
  /* ðŸ‘† image height / width * 100% */
  position: relative;
}
.image {
  width: 100%;
  height: auto;
  position: absolute;
}
```

## The modern way 1 - mapped `aspect-ratio`

The modern and simpler way is to define a width / height aspect ratio implicitly by [defining the width and height attributes on images and videos](https://twitter.com/addyosmani/status/1276779799198007301). This is called "mapped aspect-ratio".

```html
<img
  alt="An image"
  src="image.jpg"
  width="200"
  height="300"
/>

<video
  alt="A video"
  src="video.mp4"
  width="1600"
  height="900"
>
  ...
</video>
```

```css
/* Modern browser stylesheets will add a default
  aspect ratio based on the element's existing 
  width and height attributes */
img,
video {
  aspect-ratio: attr(width) / attr(height);
}
```

The good news is that either Chromium browsers (Chrome, Microsoft Egde, and Opera), Firefox and Safari (starting version 14) now support mapped `aspect-ratio`! So the vast majority of browsers is covered, and Internet Explorer is slowly dying, while Microsoft Edge is ramping up.

But there are some caveats when using JavaScript-powered lazy loading.

### Demos

I've created a set of demos on Codepen to test mapped `aspect-ratio` in different cases.

| Use case                                                     | Works? | Demo                                          |
| ------------------------------------------------------------ | ------ | --------------------------------------------- |
| Native lazy loading (no placeholders required)               | ðŸŸ¢ Yes | [Demo](https://codepen.io/verlok/pen/ExPwzGO) |
| Javascript lazy loading (no placeholders, no `display` fix)  | ðŸ”´ No  | [Demo](https://codepen.io/verlok/pen/bGEYyZe) |
| Javascript lazy loading (no placeholders, with `display` fix)     | ðŸŸ¢ Yes | [Demo](https://codepen.io/verlok/pen/RwKeoBX) |
| Javascript lazy loading (SVG placeholders, no `display` fix) | ðŸŸ¢ Yes | [Demo](https://codepen.io/verlok/pen/zYNmoxz) |

With `display` fix I mean I needed to set the images `display` property to `block`, because leaving its value to the default one (`inline-block`) didn't work out for Javascript lazy-loaded images.

With "Works?" I mean if the browser reserved space for the images before they were loaded. 
To check if it works yourself, use your browser's developer tools to disable the cache and emulate a "slow 3G" network speed.
You should see some space is reserved _before_ the images start loading, so the paragraph is rendered way below the images.

## The modern way 2 - explicit `aspect-ratio`

In the future, you will also be able to explicitly set the aspect ratio in your CSS code using [the aspect-ratio CSS rule](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/aspect-ratio).

```html
<div class="async">
  Content is loading...
</div>
```

```css
.async {
  aspect-ratio: 16/9;
}
```

~~Unfortunately, this has currently (April 2021) supported only by Chromium browsers. We still don't know if and when this will be supported in future versions of Safari.~~

**November 2021 update:** this is now [supported](https://caniuse.com/mdn-css_properties_aspect-ratio) by all latest versions of all browsers (except for Internet Explorer, but... well).


## Conclusion

Yay! It is possible to use mapped `aspect-ratio` to reserve space for your lazily loaded content like images and videos today!

Just set the `width` and `height` attributes to images and pick one of the following three ways: 

1. Use native lazy loading with `loading=lazy`
2. Use JavaScript lazy loading with no placeholders, but applying `display: block` to the images
3. Use JavaScript lazy loading with placeholders

I can't wait to know how you reduced your pages' [CLS](https://web.dev/cls) using these techniques.
