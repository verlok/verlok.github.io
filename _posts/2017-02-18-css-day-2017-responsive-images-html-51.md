On March 17th 2017 I spoke about **responsive images, an HTML 5.1 standard** at the [CSS Day 2017 Conference](http://2017.cssday.it) in Faenza, Italy. The speech was on web performance, since using responsive images is a way to serve lighter images to smaller screens (and viceversa) and images optimization. I also took a sneak peek on how to generate the right size for your images in the cloud using a software as a service.

Here are the slides of my talk, from my <a href="https://www.slideshare.net/verlok">SlideShare</a>:

The video of the talk is also available <a href="https://vimeo.com/213316110">here</a> and below (italian only, sorry to non-italian speakers).
