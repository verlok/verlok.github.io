Ahoy, front-end pirates! Today I'm starting a saga about the front-end development of the site of the [2012 edition of the From the Front conference](http://2012.fromthefront.it) which took place in Bologna, Italy on September the 20th.

The chapters of the saga will be:

*   Chapter 1 - **The splashing title** (coming tomorrow!)
*   Chapter 2 - **The blowing clouds** (coming soon)
*   Chapter 3 - **The rising smoke**  (coming soon)
*   Chapter 4 - **The swinging boat**  (coming soon)
*   Chapter 5 - **The shady pirates** (coming soon)

Every chapter will be about the libraries I used, the techniques I applies, the troubles I went through and the related workarounds.

Come back tomorrow to read **Chapter 1 - The splashing title**.
