Hello, I'm Andrea, and I love to craft and/or optimise websites. I'm passionate about user experience and especially web performance. I've been programming since I was 9, which was 3.5 decades ago.

I write about the web on this tech blog, on Medium and Smashing Magazine, and I love to speak at conferences about the web.

I'm a father of two, a GitHub fan, and the proud creator of [vanilla-lazyload](https://github.com/verlok/vanilla-lazyload). 

I love nature in all of its forms and - when I'm not geeking around - I love cycling, hiking, eating local food, and all kinds of foreign and regional languages and cultures.

My current job at [Netcentric](https://www.netcentric.biz) is focused on web performance optimisation. [More on LinkedIn](https://linkedin.com/in/andreaverlicchi)
